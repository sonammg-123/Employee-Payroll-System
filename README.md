Employee Payroll System (Java OOPs)

This is a simple Java project I built to practice and showcase Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) concepts. Itâ€™s a mini payroll system where you can add employees, calculate their salaries, remove them, and display details â€” all while applying abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

âœ¨ What it does

Keeps track of employees (full-time & part-time).

Calculates salaries (monthly for full-time, hourly for part-time).

Lets you add or remove employees easily.

ðŸš€ How to run

Clone or download the repo.

Open the project in any Java IDE (Eclipse / IntelliJ / VS Code).

Run Main.java to see it in action.
